# SimpleSquanch (SSQ)

The squanchy alternative to SSQ inspired by the [Varint serializer of Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints) and @metachris's [minimalistic approach](https://github.com/metachris/binary-serializer#base-128-varints).

## What is it?

A serialization scheme supporting simple binary fields of variable length. 


### Features
- Space-efficient
- Varints do not require a fixed length. 


### How does it work?
The delimitation of the fields relies on the MSB of each byte which is used as a flag to signal whether there are more bytes to process.

For example:
- If the payload fits in 7 bits (=1 byte without MSB), then the MSB is set to 0
- If the payload needs 2 or more bytes, each byte's MSB is set to 0 except the last one (from right to left).


### Limitations
- No support for complex types such as arrays, mappings or nesting.
- No concern with data types (signed/unsigned integers, strings etc), everything is bytes.


### Differences

In SSQ, the MSB flag has a different meaning:
  - In SSQ, the MSB flag means "there are more bytes after this one", assuming that they are processed from least to most significant (right to left).
  - In Protobuf and Metachris serializer, it is assumed that they are processed from the most to least significant (left to right) instead.
  - The rationale for SSQ is that it appeared to make an humble decoding implementation more straightforward.

#### Differences with ProtoBuf
- SSQ lacks 98% of most of ProtoBuf's features: no (proto) schema, no nesting, no optional or repeating field, no string...
- Protobuf encodes the Varint's LSB first.
- Optimized for speed, closer to the network wire order

#### Differences with Metachris binary serializer
- SSQ supports only Varints, not packages.


### Simple Specifications

Each byte uses 7 bits for the payload storage, the MSB being reserved as a "more bytes after this?" flag.
```
Bit Values: [ x | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 ]
              | 
              + last-varint-byte indicator (0=last, 1=next-also-length-byte)
```

Therefore we can store:
- in 1 byte: any value between 0x00..0x7F
- in 2 bytes: any value between 0x00..0x3FFF 
...

There is a loss of 1 bit of storage but it is compensated by not having to either:
- reserve additional space for a Length field (to allow for variable length)
- agree on a fixed length now while attempting to predict the future possible range of values for the field.

### Encoding examples

```
    input      |  [  varint byte 1  ] | [  varint byte 0  ] | [ output ]
---------------+----------------------+---------------------+--------------  
    1 = 0x0001 |                      | [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ] |   0x0001
  127 = 0x007F |                      | [ 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ] |   0x0007
  128 = 0x0080 |  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ] | [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] |   0x0180
  255 = 0x00FF |  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ] | [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ] |   0x01FF
  256 = 0x0100 |  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ] | [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] |   0x0280
16383 = 0x3FFF |  [ 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ] | [ 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ] |   0x7FFF
     ...

    input      |  [  varint byte 2  ] | [  varint byte 1  ] | [  varint byte 0  ] | [ output ]
---------------+----------------------+---------------------+---------------------+------------  
16484 = 0x4000 |  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 ] | [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] | [ 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] |  0x018080
